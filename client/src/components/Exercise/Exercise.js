            If you‚Äôre dreaming of lean and muscular physic, then make sure your
            workout includes exercises to build muscle. Despite what many women
            think, building muscle doesn‚Äôt automatically make you look big and
            bulky. Strength training is key to looking strong and toned. It can
            also help you burn fat and lose weight in the long run.

            If you‚Äôre looking for exercises to build muscle that doesn‚Äôt require
            any equipment, then push-ups are the way to go. While they mainly
            work your upper body (triceps, pectoral muscles, and shoulders),
            push-ups can also strengthen your core and lower back. Start with 5
            or 10 each morning. Then, slowly add more every couple of days to
            build up your strength and endurance.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph-text">
            If a full push-up is too difficult, you can also modify the pose to
            make things easier. Rest your hands on a higher surface or do a
            push-up on your knees instead
          </p>

            Normal squats are great for building muscle in your lower body. But
            add a kettlebell to the mix, and you‚Äôll see even more progress! Just
            that little bit of weight will help you work your upper body and
            core. For a more intense workout, try a kettlebell swing instead..

            Burpees are a must if you want to know how to build muscle fast.
            This full-body exercise consists of planks, squats, and jumps, all

            enough, you‚Äôll also get a cardio workout too.

            High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a workout that usually
            includes burpees (along with many other exercises). You alternate
            certain exercises with periods of rest, which burns more calories
            than working out at a steady pace.
