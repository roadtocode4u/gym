              For those trying to add more muscle, milk is an excellent protein source that provides both casein and whey proteins. Research has even shown it can help you add muscle when combined with weightlifting.
              </li>
              <li className="paragraph-text">
              Additionally, studies have found that milk, or whey and casein combined, can lead to greater mass gain than other protein sources.
              </li>
              <li className="paragraph-text">
              Try drinking one or two glasses of whole milk (149 calories per cup) as a snack, with a meal, or before and after a workout if you‚Äôre training.
              </li>
              <li className="paragraph-text">
              Milk smoothies are also a delicious way to add milk to your diet. For an easy morning protein boost, try blending up 1 cup of frozen berries, 1 cup of whole milk, 2 teaspoons of honey, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla (about 275 calories).

            Rice is a convenient, low cost carb source to help you gain weight. Just 1 cup (158 grams) of cooked white rice provides 204 calories, 44 grams of carbs, and very little fat.

            <ol>
              <li className="paragraph-text">
              Rice is also fairly calorie-dense, meaning you can easily obtain a high amount of carbs and calories from a single serving. This helps you eat more food, especially if you have a poor appetite or get full quickly.
              </li>
              <li className="paragraph-text">
              When you‚Äôre on the go or in a rush, 2-minute packs of microwavable rice can be easily added to other protein sources and premade meals.
              </li>
              <li className="paragraph-text">
              Another popular method is to prepare a large pot of rice, refrigerate it or freeze individual portions, and then combine it with different proteins and healthy fats for varied meals throughout the week
              </li>
              <li className="paragraph-text">
              There are many ways to turn relatively bland rice into a taste extravaganza. The easiest way to add taste, calories, and a protein boost is to simply stir in some of these ingredients after you have cooked your rice:

              You can add nut butters to a variety of snacks or dishes, such as smoothies, yogurts, and crackers, to turn them into a high calorie snack in no time.

              <li className="paragraph-text">
              For a quick pick-me-up, try this peanut butter banana smoothie, with only three ingredients (270 calories, using whole milk). If you have a peanut allergy, substitute another nut butter.
              </li>
              <li className="paragraph-text">
              However, make sure you pick 100 percent nut butters with no added sugar or extra oils. Or better yet, make your own from this homemade almond butter recipe. It‚Äôs easy to make and easy on your wallet, too.
